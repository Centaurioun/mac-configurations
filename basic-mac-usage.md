https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/mac-help/use-apps-in-split-view-mchl4fbe2921/10.14/mac/10.14

Many apps on your Mac support Split View mode, where you can work in two apps side by side at the same time.

Two apps side by side in Split View.
On your Mac, in the top-left corner of an app window, click and hold the green button, drag the window to the side you want, then release the button.

The button to click for entering full screen.
On the other side of the screen, click the second app you want to work with.

In Split View, do any of the following:

Make one side bigger: Move the pointer over the separator bar located in the middle, then drag it left or right. To return to the original sizes, double-click the separator bar.

Change sides: Use a window’s toolbar to drag the window to the other side. If you don’t see a toolbar, click the window, then move the pointer to the top of the screen.

Show or hide the menu bar: Move the pointer to or away from the top of the screen.

Show or hide the Dock: Move the pointer to or away from the Dock’s location.

To stop using an app in Split View, click its window, show the menu bar, then click the green button in the window’s top-left corner or press Control-Command-F.  
The remaining app expands to full screen and can be accessed in the Spaces bar. To stop using the app full screen, move the pointer over its thumbnail in the Spaces bar,  
then click the Exit button  that appears in the top-left corner of the thumbnail.

If you’re using an app full screen, you can quickly choose another app to work with in Split View. 
Press Control-Up Arrow (or swipe up with three or four fingers) to enter Mission Control, then drag a window from Mission Control onto the thumbnail of the full-screen app in the Spaces bar.  
You can also drag one app thumbnail onto another in the Spaces bar.
