If you have pdf file already then you can reduce pdf file size using `Preview app`.
1. Open file using preview app  
2. File --> Export --> format --> pdf --> Quartz filter --> Reduce file size.  

But if you have converted image to pdf and then you want to reduce pdf file size then instead of following above approach, do as follows:
1. Open image in Preview app  
2. File --> Export --> format --> <image extention> --> change Quality slider and check file size value --> Save  
3. Now change this image to pdf file by File --> Export as PDF
